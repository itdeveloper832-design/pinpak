// Business detail route — two kinds of listings:
// 1. SEED listings (lib/seed-businesses.ts): directory-created pages for
//    real businesses. They are listed in generateStaticParams, so
//    they are prerendered to fully static HTML at build time — zero
//    Firestore reads and no ISR (this file sets no `revalidate` for
//    them; the revalidate below covers Firestore listings only).
// 2. FIRESTORE listings (owner-added via the dashboard): any other slug
//    is fetched HERE, on the server, and handed to the client island
//    as props: the profile renders into the initial HTML and the
//    browser makes no Firestore read for it. Only the interactive
//    parts (reviews) still run client-side.
//
//    Note the public URL now reflects PUBLIC visibility only: the
//    server reads anonymously, so a Firestore listing appears here
//    exactly when a visitor could see it — status 'approved' and past
//    its weekly release boundary. Owners manage pending listings from
//    their dashboard; admins from the admin panel. Missing and
//    non-approved slugs are a real 404 (notFound), not a soft-404
//    page at HTTP 200; approved-but-unreleased slugs keep their
//    deliberate release-date state.
